#### Prerequisites
* Basic understanding of vector geometry and hyperplanes.
* Proficiency in Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
* Awareness of the importance of feature scaling.

#### How to Use Effectively
1.  Load your data.
2.  **Always scale your features** before feeding them to an SVM. This is critical for performance.
3.  Initialize `SVC` (for classification) or `SVR` (for regression).
4.  Experiment with different kernels (`linear`, `rbf`, `poly`) to find the best fit for your data.
5.  Train the model using `.fit()` and evaluate its performance.
