#### Prerequisites
* Basic understanding of Python programming.
* Familiarity with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Scikit-learn for modeling.
* Conceptual knowledge of what a tree-based model is.

#### How to Use Effectively
1.  Load your dataset using Pandas.
2.  Separate your features (X) and target variable (y).
3.  Initialize the `DecisionTreeClassifier` or `DecisionTreeRegressor` from Scikit-learn.
4.  Train the model using the `.fit(X, y)` method.
5.  Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

If anything feels hard or you have a doubt, from small to big, please ask. You might get your doubt solved using AI, but it can hallucinate or provide contextually incorrect information. As the creator of this repo, I know every detail presented here. Please have an open mind and don't hesitate to drop your questions. I would love to help, 24/7.

After mastering these concepts, we will use these learning resources to build production-level applications and make open-source contributions. Pinning your contributions to this open-source project on your resume will help you stand out from the crowd.
