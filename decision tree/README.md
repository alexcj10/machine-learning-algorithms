# Decision Trees ðŸŒ³

## ðŸ“– What's Inside

This folder contains **in-depth handwritten notes** on Decision Tree algorithms, covering the mathematical foundations and intuitions behind how trees make decisions.

### Topics Covered

- What are Decision Trees and how they work
- Splitting criteria (Gini Impurity, Entropy, Information Gain)
- Tree construction algorithms (ID3, C4.5, CART)
- Pruning techniques to prevent overfitting
- Handling categorical and continuous features
- Mathematical derivations with step-by-step explanations
- Practical insights on when to use decision trees

## âœ… Prerequisites

Before diving into these notes, you should be comfortable with:

- **Basic Probability** â€” Understanding of probability distributions and conditional probability
- **Statistics Fundamentals** â€” Mean, variance, and basic statistical concepts
- **Logarithms** â€” Used in entropy and information gain calculations
- **Basic Calculus** (optional) â€” Helpful but not strictly required

If you're new to these topics, check out the fundamentals section first.

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use These Notes

1. **Start from the beginning** â€” The notes build concepts progressively
2. **Work through examples** â€” Don't skip the worked examples
3. **Understand the intuition** â€” Focus on *why* we use certain metrics, not just *what* they are
4. **Practice calculations** â€” Try computing Gini or entropy values yourself
5. **Connect to implementation** â€” Think about how this translates to code

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

After studying these notes, you'll understand:
- How decision trees split data to create decision boundaries
- The mathematics behind impurity measures
- Why and how to prune trees to improve generalization
- The strengths and limitations of decision tree algorithms
