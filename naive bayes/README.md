#### Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge of probability, specifically Bayes' Theorem.
* Familiarity with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
* Understanding of conditional independence assumption.

#### How to Use Effectively
1.  Prepare your data, ensuring it is in the correct format. Naive Bayes works well with text data (e.g., word counts).
2.  Choose the right type of Naive Bayes model for your data (`GaussianNB` for continuous features, `MultinomialNB` for discrete counts, etc.).
3.  Initialize the model from Scikit-learn.
4.  Train it with your features (X) and target (y) using `.fit()`. It's a very fast algorithm to train.

If anything feels hard or you have a doubt, from small to big, please ask. You might get your doubt solved using AI, but it can hallucinate or provide contextually incorrect information.
