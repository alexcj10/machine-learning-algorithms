#### Prerequisites
* Basic understanding of probability and linear algebra.
* Familiarity with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
* Knowledge of classification problems.

#### How to Use Effectively
1.  Load and split your data into features (X) and a binary/multiclass target (y).
2.  It's good practice to scale your features for this algorithm.
3.  Initialize the `LogisticRegression` model from Scikit-learn.
4.  Train the model using `.fit(X, y)`.
5.  Use it to predict class labels or probabilities.

If anything feels hard or you have a doubt, from small to big, please ask. You might get your doubt solved using AI, but it can hallucinate or provide contextually incorrect information. As the creator of this repo, I know every detail presented here. Please have an open mind and don't hesitate to drop your questions. I would love to help, 24/7.

After mastering these concepts, we will use these learning resources to build production-level applications and make open-source contributions. Pinning your contributions to this open-source project on your resume will help you stand out from the crowd.
