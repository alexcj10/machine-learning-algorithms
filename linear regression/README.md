#### Prerequisites
* Understanding of basic algebra (equation of a line, y = mx + c).
* Knowledge of Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
* Familiarity with regression problems (predicting continuous values).

#### How to Use Effectively
1.  Load your dataset.
2.  Identify your independent variables (X) and the dependent variable (y) you want to predict.
3.  Initialize the `LinearRegression` model.
4.  Train it with your data using `.fit(X, y)`.
5.  Check the model's coefficients and intercept to understand the relationship it has learned.

If anything feels hard or you have a doubt, from small to big, please ask. You might get your doubt solved using AI, but it can hallucinate or provide contextually incorrect information.
