## 🎯 Why This Repository?

Machine learning textbooks often overwhelm beginners with **heavy mathematical notation** and complex derivations. This creates an unnecessary barrier between you and understanding how ML algorithms actually work.

**This repository solves that problem.**

Here you'll find **handwritten notes** and **curated resources** that break down the mathematics behind ML algorithms into clear, intuitive explanations. These materials are designed to work **alongside** your textbooks, online courses, or research papers—helping you decode the math and build genuine understanding.

> **The Goal:** Make the mathematical foundations of machine learning accessible to everyone, regardless of their mathematical background.
