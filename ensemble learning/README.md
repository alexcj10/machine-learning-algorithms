#### Prerequisites
* Solid understanding of Decision Trees and basic ML algorithms.
* Knowledge of Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
* Basic idea of the concept of "ensemble learning"â€”combining multiple models (weak learners) to form a stronger predictive model.

#### How to Use Effectively
1.  Prepare your data by loading it and separating features (X) from the target (y).
2.  Select an ensemble algorithm suitable for your task:
    - For bagging: `BaggingClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `RandomForestRegressor`
    - For boosting: `AdaBoostClassifier`, `GradientBoostingClassifier`, `XGBClassifier`
    - For voting: `VotingClassifier`
    - For stacking: `StackingClassifier`
3.  Initialize the chosen ensemble model with desired parameters.
4.  Train the model using `.fit(X, y)`.
5.  Evaluate its performance and use it for predictions. Each ensemble method has unique strengths for various data problems and often improves performance over individual models.
