#### Prerequisites
* Solid understanding of Decision Trees.
* Knowledge of Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
* Basic idea of what "ensemble learning" means.

#### How to Use Effectively
1.  Prepare your data by loading it and separating features (X) from the target (y).
2.  Initialize the `RandomForestClassifier` or `RandomForestRegressor`.
3.  Train the model on your dataset with `.fit(X, y)`.
4.  Evaluate its performance and use it for predictions. Random Forest is powerful for handling complex datasets and preventing overfitting.

If anything feels hard or you have a doubt, from small to big, please ask. You might get your doubt solved using AI, but it can hallucinate or provide contextually incorrect information. As the creator of this repo, I know every detail presented here. Please have an open mind and don't hesitate to drop your questions. I would love to help, 24/7.

After mastering these concepts, we will use these learning resources to build production-level applications and make open-source contributions. Pinning your contributions to this open-source project on your resume will help you stand out from the crowd.
