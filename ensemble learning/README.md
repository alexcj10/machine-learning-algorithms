# Ensemble Learning ðŸŽ­

## ðŸ“– What's Inside

This folder contains **in-depth handwritten notes** on Ensemble Learning methods, covering how combining multiple models creates more powerful predictions than any single model.

### Topics Covered

- Ensemble Learning fundamentals and intuition
- **Bagging** (Bootstrap Aggregating)
  - Random Forests
  - Bootstrap sampling
  - Out-of-Bag error estimation
- **Boosting**
  - AdaBoost
  - Gradient Boosting
  - XGBoost concepts
- **Stacking** and model combination strategies
- Bias-Variance tradeoff in ensembles
- Mathematical foundations and derivations
- When and why ensembles outperform single models

## âœ… Prerequisites

Before diving into these notes, you should understand:

- **Decision Trees** â€” Essential foundation for understanding Random Forests and boosting
- **Basic Probability & Statistics** â€” Sampling, distributions, and expectation
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff** â€” Core ML concept
- **Loss Functions** â€” Understanding of how models are optimized
- **Basic Calculus** â€” Helpful for gradient boosting derivations

**Recommended:** Study Decision Trees first, as ensemble methods heavily build on them.

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use These Notes

1. **Master decision trees first** â€” They're the building blocks
2. **Start with bagging** â€” It's the simplest ensemble technique
