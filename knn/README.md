#### Prerequisites
* Understanding of basic geometry (distance metrics like Euclidean distance).
* Knowledge of Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
* Familiarity with the concept of feature scaling.

#### How to Use Effectively
1.  Load and prepare your data.
2.  **Crucially, scale your features** using `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler`, as KNN is sensitive to the range of data.
3.  Initialize `KNeighborsClassifier` or `KNeighborsRegressor`, choosing an appropriate value for 'k' (n_neighbors).
4.  Train the model using `.fit()` and make predictions.

If anything feels hard or you have a doubt, from small to big, please ask. You might get your doubt solved using AI, but it can hallucinate or provide contextually incorrect information. As the creator of this repo, I know every detail presented here. Please have an open mind and don't hesitate to drop your questions. I would love to help, 24/7.

After mastering these concepts, we will use these learning resources to build production-level applications and make open-source contributions. Pinning your contributions to this open-source project on your resume will help you stand out from the crowd.
