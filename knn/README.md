# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ðŸŽ¯

## ðŸ“– What's Inside

This folder contains **in-depth handwritten notes** on the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, one of the simplest yet powerful machine learning algorithms.

### Topics Covered

- Core concept: How KNN makes predictions
- Distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski)
- Choosing the optimal value of K
- Weighted KNN and voting mechanisms
- KNN for classification and regression
- Computational complexity and efficiency
- Curse of dimensionality
- Practical considerations and best practices

## âœ… Prerequisites

Before studying these notes, you should know:

- **Basic Linear Algebra** â€” Understanding of vectors and vector operations
- **Distance Metrics** â€” Euclidean distance formula
- **Basic Probability** â€” Understanding of majority voting and weighted averages
- **Python/Programming Basics** (optional) â€” Helpful for implementation understanding

These are beginner-friendly notes, so don't worry if your math background is limited!

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use These Notes

1. **Understand the intuition first** â€” KNN is beautifully simple at its core
2. **Visualize the concept** â€” Draw points and see how neighbors influence predictions
3. **Study distance metrics** â€” Understand when to use which distance measure
4. **Experiment with K values** â€” Learn the bias-variance tradeoff
5. **Note the limitations** â€” Understanding weaknesses is as important as strengths

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

After studying these notes, you'll understand:
- How KNN makes predictions using nearby data points
- Different ways to measure "closeness" between points
- How to choose K and why it matters
- When KNN works well and when it struggles
- Computational considerations for large datasets
